* This application manages and displays inventory for a local wine distributor.

* On the 'main inventory' page the user is able to add new varietals and vintages into inventory, update inventory amounts for wines and box types, and view the current actual inventory and shadow inventory based on varietal.

* On the 'clients' page the user is able to add new clients into the database, add an order for a client, add a 'promised' amount to a client account, and add notes to a clients' account.

* The 'clients' page allows the user to view individual accounts and any information (i.e. orders, promised, notes, contact info) associated with the account. 

* The databases are kept on mySQL and jawsDB.

* This application was built using nodeJs, express, handlebars and sequelize.
